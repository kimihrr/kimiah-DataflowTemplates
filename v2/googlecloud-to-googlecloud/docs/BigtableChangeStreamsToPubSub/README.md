# Bigtable Change Streams To PubSub Dataflow Template

The [BigtableChangeStreamsToPubSub]
(src/main/java/com/google/cloud/teleport/v2/templates/BigtableChangeStreamsToPubSub.java)
pipeline reads messages from Cloud Bigtable Change Streams and publish messages with a changelog schema into topics in
PubSub. The supported message formats could be AVRO or Protocol Buffer.


Changelog schema is defined as follows:
